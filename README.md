Required packages:
-opencv(cv2)
-deepface: https://github.com/serengil/deepface
-streamlit


You will also need to use Visual Studio code and download the following extensions: TODO, Github, and draw.io (to see the flow charts, not needed but its cool!)

To run:
Download all the packages you need and set everything up in the same virtual env as deepface for the recognition and deep learning. Then cd into the deepface_env, and run via "streamlit run chatFrontend.py". Wait for the facial detection to finish and chat away!

Desc:
This branch/version is for the basic face detection, face recognition, and deep learning portion of the larger project which will be a "therapy bot" of sorts.
